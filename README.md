# thinkpad-E14-prebuilt-opencore-efi

This is my opencore efi for a thinkpad e14 gen1 running on a i3-10110U.
I decided to upload my efi so people wont have to go through the hassle of making/troubleshooting their own opencore efi.

If it doesnt work for any reason, build your own with [OpCore-Simplify](https://github.com/lzhoang2801/OpCore-Simplify). You will have to map all usb ports manually.

Enjoy!
