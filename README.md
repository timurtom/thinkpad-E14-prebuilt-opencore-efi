# thinkpad-E14-prebuilt-opencore-efi

This is my opencore efi for a thinkpad e14 gen1 (i think) thats running on a i3-10110U
i decided to upload my efi so people wont have to go through the hassle of making/troubleshooting their own opencore efi

if it doesnt work ( for any reason ), build ur own with OpCore-simplify(https://github.com/lzhoang2801/OpCore-Simplify). u are gonna have to map all usb ports by urself tho

Enjoy!
